Below is a high-level overview of the entire project, assuming the following setup:

- **Electron-React-Boilerplate** as the starting template.
- **Yarn** as the package manager.
- **macOS** as the target platform.
- **React** for the frontend user interface.
- **Electron** for creating a native-like Mac application, accessible via the menu bar.
- **OpenAI Whisper** for transcribing recorded audio.
- **ChatGPT API** for summarizing the transcribed text.
- **User-supplied OpenAI API key** for authentication with OpenAI services.

### Overview of the Project’s Functionality

1. **Menu Bar Integration:**  
   The app will live in the Mac menu bar as a tray icon. Clicking the tray icon opens a small React-based popup window where the user can start or stop recording, view transcripts, and read summaries.

2. **Recording System Audio:**  
   When the user clicks “Record,” the app will capture system audio. This will likely require using a virtual audio device (e.g., BlackHole) or a similar setup to route system audio into the app. The raw audio will be saved temporarily on the user’s machine.

3. **Transcription with Whisper:**  
   Once recording is stopped, the captured audio will be sent to OpenAI’s Whisper API (or a local Whisper model) to obtain a text transcription.

4. **Summarization with ChatGPT:**  
   Using the transcription, the app will send a request to the ChatGPT API to get a summary. The user’s own OpenAI API key (stored securely in local storage or the system keychain) will be used for authentication.

5. **Display Results in UI:**  
   The summarized text will be displayed in the popup window, with an option to copy the summary. The user can also review the original transcription.

### Technical Steps (Conceptual)

1. **Project Setup with electron-react-boilerplate (ERB):**
   - Clone the ERB repository.
   - Install dependencies using `yarn install`.
   - Run the development mode using `yarn dev`.
   - Confirm the React/Electron environment is working before adding features.

2. **Menu Bar and Popover Window:**
   - Use the Electron `Tray` module to create a tray icon.
   - On tray icon click, show/hide a small `BrowserWindow` containing your React UI.  
   - This transforms the default ERB setup (which shows a standard window) into a menu bar style application.

3. **Frontend (React) UI Structure:**
   - A simple popup panel for record control:
     - A “Record” button (toggles between start and stop).
     - A “Transcribe & Summarize” button or automatic trigger after stopping the recording.
     - A section to display transcription text and summarized text.
   - A settings panel to input and store the user’s OpenAI API key.

4. **Audio Recording:**
   - Integrate a Node.js module or native Electron integration to record system audio.
   - Choose an audio format compatible with Whisper (e.g., WAV or MP3).
   - Trigger recording start/stop from the React UI, and handle recording logic in the main Electron process or a preload script.

5. **Transcription with Whisper:**
   - After recording stops, send the audio file to the Whisper API endpoint.
   - Parse the returned transcription text and store it in the app’s state.

6. **Summarization with ChatGPT:**
   - Once transcription is complete, send the text to the ChatGPT endpoint.
   - Use the user-provided API key for authentication.
   - Receive summarized text and display it in the UI.

7. **Local Storage and Security:**
   - Store the user’s OpenAI API key securely (e.g., encrypted file or macOS Keychain).
   - Temporarily store the audio file and transcription.
   - Clean up temporary files after use.

8. **Testing & Packaging:**
   - Test recording and transcription with sample audio.
   - Test summarization with known transcripts.
   - Use `yarn build` and Electron packaging tools to create a Mac app bundle.
   - Ensure the tray behavior, popover window, and API interactions work in production mode.

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
- Add error handling and retry logic for API requests.
- Allow customization of transcription or summary prompts.
- Add support for multiple languages if needed.
- Maintain a history log of past transcriptions and summaries.
